# Midi map and mixer template

## WARNING: This is AS-IS and does come with any support
A midi map for Traktor specifically and a template file with a mixer midi ready for Traktor or other dj software. 

I made this to compliment my X1 mk-3 because I didn't have a soundcard mixer or z-1 to go with it, and I dont like the 4th knob as the faders. So I made one with Lemur. Since there is a limitation in Lemur to only allow wide screen I originally had this as a nice long mixer with long faders. Nope, so we have this wide version. As of now, I do not plan on updating these files beyond this version for various reasons.

## Additional Setup
You will want to make sure Lemur is pumping out over midi 0 and midi 1 for both decks to work in Traktor. In Traktor settings, make sure the conrol script is listening on all ports not just deamon 0 or 1. 

**Template features are:**

- 4 fader channels
- FX section
- Gains and cue buttons
- Working Fader and Master L/R LED's (Could be refined but good > perfect. Inspired by Traxus)
- EQ with kill switches
- Basic transport controls
- 4 cues and roll pads (Borrowed from another template that wasn't mine.)
- Master volume
- Cue and split faders

Enjoy. If anyone wants to improve on the template or midi map please open a PR or DM me. Or fork it.
